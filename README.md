# Tech Babes Garden 🌸

Inspired by GitHub’s contribution heatmap, this interactive tracker lets users visualize activity in a fun and creative way. Instead of the classic green squares, I’ve customized it with a pink gradient version and a blue gradient version to match the [Tech Babes](https://techbabes.dev/) brand.

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive heatmap: click the squares to design your own garden (they get darker the more you click)
- Two gardens available: Pink & Blue, matching the Tech Babes brand colors   
- “Randomize” button: fill the garden with a random pattern instantly  
- Fun, addictive, and perfect for creating your own little digital garden or some pixel art

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Frontend: React + Vite  
- Styling: CSS  
- Deployment: (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
